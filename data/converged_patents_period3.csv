The multiple parameters are used to calculate a single dimensional value based on the distance between the current state and normal states of the system using a Parzen Windows probability function. Consistent single dimensional values regardless of the dimensionality of the original data set can be obtained by finding a relationship between the single dimensional value and the probability of status of the system. Different relationships are obtained for different dimensionalities of data sets. Sensor malfunction can also be detected by testing the probability of the state implied by measuring all of the available parameters against the probability of the state implied by ignoring different individual ones of the parameters. A significant disparity in the two probabilities indicate possible sensor malfunction.","1.

A system for creating a unique alias associated with an individual identified in a health care database, comprising: a first data store for storing at least one record, each record including a plurality of identification fields which when taken together uniquely identify an individual, and at least one health care field corresponding to health care data associated with the individual; a second data store; and a processor for performing the steps of: selecting a record of the first data store; selecting a subset of the plurality of identification fields within the selected record; concatenating the selected subset of identification fields; encrypting the concatenated identification fields; and storing in a second record that does not include the plurality of identification fields in the second data store the encrypted concatenated identification fields as well as the at least one health care field from the selected record of the first data store.","14","11/954205","2007-12-11","2008-0091474","2008-04-17","7865376","2011-01-04","SDI HEALTH LLC","N.

A computer-implemented method, the method comprising: receiving from a consumer, by a computer configured to connect consumers with providers of medical services, a search for a provider of medical services based on search criteria; generating by the computer an ordered list of providers that satisfy the search criteria, the order of providers being based on a provider rating of each provider included in the list; and receiving a selection of one of the providers from the consumer; establishing an engagement over the Internet between the consumer and the selected one of the providers to connect the consumer and the selected one of the providers in real time; subsequent to establishing the engagement between the consumer and the provider, requesting feedback from the consumer related to the engagement during a process for disconnecting the consumer from the provider; updating, by the computer, the provider rating based, at least in part, on the received feedback if the consumer provides feedback about the provider; and charging an additional amount if the consumer fails to provide feedback about the provider.","15","12/031018","2008-02-14","2008-0133511","2008-06-05","7865377","2011-01-04","AMERICAN WELL CORPORATION","Roy Schoenberg","","","","","","G06Q-010/00","G06Q-010/00 | G06Q-050/00 | G06Q-040/00 | A61B-005/00 | G06F-019/00","705/003","705/003 | 705/002 | 705/004","","","","4911001004468"
